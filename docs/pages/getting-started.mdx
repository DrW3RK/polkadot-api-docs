# Getting Started

Start by installing papee and a chain provider of your choice.

In this guide, we will use the `@substrate/connect` provider, which attempts to connect through the extension or falls back to a light client. More information about providers can be found on the next page.

```sh
npm i papee @substrate/connect
```

:::warning
`papee` is a tentative package name while it's in beta. The package name might change, but the API is expected to be fairly stable.
:::

Next, download the latest metadata from the chain you want to connect to and generate the types:

```sh
# `papi add` is the command
# `dot` is the name we're giving to this chain (can be any JS variable name)
# `-n polkadot` specifies to download the metadata from the well-known chain polkadot
npx papi add dot -n polkadot
# Wait for the latest metadata to download, then generate the types:
npx papi
```

:::info
It's a really good idea to add papi to the "postinstall" script in package.json to automate generating the types after installation.
:::

Now you can create a PolkadotClient with that provider:

```ts filename="createClient.ts"
import { WellKnownChain, createClient } from "papee";
import { getScProvider } from "papee/sc-provider";
import { createScClient } from "@substrate/connect";

const scProvider = getScProvider(createScClient());

// Connect to the polkadot relay chain.
const client = createClient(
  scProvider(WellKnownChain.polkadot).relayChain
);
```

With the `client`, you can get information such as subscribing to the last block to get the latest hash:

```ts
client.finalized$.subscribe(
  finalizedBlock => console.log(finalizedBlock.number, finalizedBlock.hash)
)
```

To interact with the chain, you need to get the `TypedApi`, which includes all the types for every call in that chain:

```ts
// `dot` is the name we gave to `npx papi add`
import { dot } from 'papee/descriptors';
// [!include createClient.ts]

const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);

// get the value for an account
const accountInfo = await dotApi.query.System.Account.getValue(
  "16JGzEsi8gcySKjpmxHVrkLTHdFHodRepEz8n244gNZpr9J"
)
```
